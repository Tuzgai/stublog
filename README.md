# stublog
A basic personal / team blog platform

This project is based heavily on Miguel Grinberg's excellent [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

Rather than a social media site, I moved in the direction of a traditional or team-based blog site - in addition to posting it supports basic user administration and access levels.

Planned features: More admin tools, tags, search and more as I have time to work on it.

You can find my living blog here: [stu.systems](http://www.stu.systems/)

You can find a live version where you can make an admin account and play around here (DB resets regularly): [stublog no db](https://stublog-no-db.herokuapp.com/)
