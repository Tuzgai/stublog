# stublog
A basic personal blog website

This project is based on Miguel Grinberg's excellent [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

Rather than a social media site, this implements a more traditional blog, with Markdown support and the ability to edit and delete posts.

Planned features: Contributor invitation and management, tags, search and more as I have time to work on it.
